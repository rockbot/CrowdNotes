=============================

Version Notes
CrowdNotes v 0.2.0 - 28 April 2012

Updated the code to work with Node.js 0.10.5, mongoose 3.x, and changed
the jade files to use blocks. Also, being new to git, I added a dumb 
commit message.

CrowdNotes v 0.1.5 - 06 Mar 2012

Cleaner code base, with MVC

CrowdNotes v0.1.1 - 06 Feb 2012

I'm switching gears from the super basic Node.js framework to using Express, Jade, Stylus, and other modules to amplify the progress of the app.

CrowdNotes v0.0.1 - 10 Jan 2012

Just getting started!
